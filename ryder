Work Report:
To every project you will submit for this class, you will add a work report with the following format to your README.md. Please do not be vague about what does not work in your project. It is very important that I know that you know what's missing from your project.

/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: Did not implement inputting of number of coins.
              Could not figure out how to ask for coin denomination AND
              number of coins in the same loop.
        -Implemented: inputting of coin denominations and calculating the total in
               Dollars has been implemented and tested.
        -Partly implemented: None

    Bugs     : features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        I started too late and was not able to spend as much time as I needed.
        inputting of numbers (and their validation) was too hard for me.
